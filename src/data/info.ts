  about: `I'm a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a strong passion for building innovative web applications and developing AI-driven projects. 
  Over the past two years, I've gained valuable industry experience, honing my skills in a wide range of technologies, including Python (Django, Streamlit), C, C++, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript (Angular, React), HTML/CSS, Tailwind, Firebase, PostgreSQL, Azure and Git.
  Originally from the Greater Boston area, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and tackle new challenges, whether through academic pursuits or personal projects. I thrive on the excitement of learning new things and am constantly seeking opportunities to grow as a developer.
